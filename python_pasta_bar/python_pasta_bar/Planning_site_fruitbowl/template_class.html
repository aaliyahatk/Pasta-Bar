					<h1>Brief</h1>
                <p> In this project we want to create 3 sprints to make computerised orders for a Pastabar. We want to include customer details, kinds of pasta ordered and pick-up or delivery requirements into a computer and have it display the delivery details, itemised order, and total cost. 
</p>

<p> <b> Reflection of sprint 1:</b></p>
<p> 
In Sprint one, I created a program that allows for the user to print out the menu of the pastas as well as quit the program at any time. I selected a range of pastas from a pastaria as well as the description of the pasta and used these in my program. When the menu of the pastas is printed out, it includes a description of the pastas as well as the cost of the pasta. This allows the user to understand what pasta they would like/ what pasta they are actually ordering as well as the price of what they are purchasing. 
I used a project backlog to help me understand what I needed to do in this sprint, which also allowed me to tick off everything that I had completed by moving it into the ‘Done’ column. I did manage to complete everything that I had put into this project backlog. 
In this sprint, I did not come across any errors when I was coding and everything worked as it was supposed to. 
My next step is to add a new function that allows the user to add pasta to their order using a list with indexes, which will ask them which pasta they would like to add to their order as well as the quantity of the pasta.

<p> <b> Reflection of sprint 2: </b> </p>
<p>
In Sprint two, I updated the program to allow the user to add pasta to their order by printing out the pasta in a list. I coded the program to print out the menu with indexes so that it is easier for the user to select which pasta they would like to add to their order. When the user adds pasta to their order they are asked which pasta they would like as well as how many of the pasta they would like that they have selected to add to their order. 
I used another project backlog in this sprint which helped me understand what I need to update in my program. This was helpful in this version because it reminded me of everything that I needed to complete and I was able to complete everything on this project backlog and move everything into the ‘Done’ column. 
As the same as sprint one, I did not come across any errors whilst I was coding these updates and everything worked as it should.
My next step is to add a new function that will allow the user to review their order (the pastas they have ordered). When the user reviews the order, I want to be able to print out the pasta they have ordered, the quantity of pasta they have ordered and the total price of the pastas.

<p> <b> Reflection of sprint 3: </b> </p>
<p>
In sprint three, I updated the program to allow the user to review their order. When the user reviews the order it prints out the name of the pastas they have ordered, the quantity of the pastas that they have ordered and the total cost of all of the pastas they have added to their order. This allows the user to see what they have ordered and how much it will cost them for their order.
I used a project backlog again for this sprint 3 and I managed to get everything complete on this project backlog and it was helpful to give me reminders along the way of what I needed to complete in this sprint.
I had no errors whilst I was working on the sprint 3, everything was working as it should be and the customer order/ review prints how I wanted it to. 
My next step of this program is to be able to edit the order by adding or deleting pastas to the customer order. To do this it is basic validation.
